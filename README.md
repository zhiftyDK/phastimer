### Changing keybind and color:
When running the app for the first time a config.ini file will be generated:
```
[DEFAULT]
keybind = r
color = #32CD32
```
* Default keybind is r (The current version of PhasTimer can only do single key binds. YOU CANT DO: ctrl+r etc.)
* Default color is lime green (Takes any hex color value)

When the config.ini file is configured to you liking, then you should just be able to open Phasmophobia and PhasTimer.
